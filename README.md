# Drone Airbag System

## Presentation

Check out our detailed presentation and demo of the Drone Airbag System, submitted for the Anveshan 3.0 hackathon, [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/14eaQb9oTpxorFrxDYrspgPLbbamYA3IDaEej-E1FhYQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Overview

In the rapidly growing drone market, valued at $43 billion in 2022 and expected to grow at a CAGR of 21.5%, drone crashes pose significant risks to safety, property, and commercial interests. Our Drone Airbag System addresses these concerns by minimizing damage and loss during accidents.

## Solution

Our system features a nylon-based airbag designed to protect drones and their cargo in the event of a crash. The airbags deploy upon detecting a collision, safeguarding the drone and its contents from high-impact collisions.

### Key Features

- **Material**: Woven nylon fabric, coated for gas impermeability and flame resistance.
- **Design**: Lightweight (680g), attaches to the bottom of the drone, and forms an inflated protective structure around all sides.
- **Detection**:
  - Gyroscopes and accelerometers for velocity and orientation changes.
  - Altitude sensors for rapid descent detection.
  - Sensors for rapid and erratic movements.

### Applications

- **Delivery Drones**: Minimize losses of fragile and valuable cargo during high-impact collisions.
- **Military Drones**: Protect sensitive equipment and data, and reduce collateral damage.
- **Collisions**: Mitigate impact during mid-air collisions, protecting both the drone and surrounding airspace.
- **Fragile Goods**: Ensure secure transportation of delicate items by reducing breakage and damage.

## Installation

The airbag system is designed to be easily tethered to existing drone models without modifications. 

## Target Users

- Commercial drone operators (delivery services, security, surveillance)
- Drone enthusiasts
- Research organizations focused on drone safety and development
